# dapp-ecosystem-map
This repo provides a framework for thinking about the ways blockchain and blockchain-based technologies (primarily Ethereum) are solving problems for end-users.

For an overview of Ethereum infrastructure layers, please refer to the Ethereum Community Foundation's market map: https://github.com/EthereumCommunityFund/ethereum-ecosystem-map

For an overview of EOS's tech stack, please refer to this picture of an empty PokeBall:

## Background
For both blockchain newcomers and OGs, it can be difficult to understand how projects are using blockchain to solve problems for end users. This document provides a framework for thinking through the various use cases of blockchain and blockchain-based technologies.

For each theme, this document captures examples of related projects. However, the inclusion of specific projects on this list does not serve as an endorsement, nor does it signal the legitimacy of specific project.

## Roadmap for this document
1) Provide map of blockchain projects by industry.
2) "Curate" ecosystem map to only include projects which meet some objective measure of legitimacy and usage.
3) Make it easier for anyone to contribute to this list.

Notes:
* Themes are neither mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive.
* Trustless exchange, decentralization, state mutation, and tokenization span each theme.
* Projects can be industry-specific or generally applicable.
