# dapp-ecosystem-map
This repo provides a framework for thinking about the ways blockchain-based projects (primarily using Ethereum) are solving problems for end-users.

For an overview of Ethereum infrastructure layers / tech stack, please refer to the Ethereum Community Foundation's market map: https://github.com/EthereumCommunityFund/ethereum-ecosystem-map

For an overview of EOS's tech stack, please refer to this picture of an empty PokeBall:

## Background
For both blockchain newcomers and OGs, it can be difficult to understand how projects are using blockchain to solve problems for end users. This document provides a framework for thinking through the various use cases of blockchain and blockchain-based technologies.

For each theme, this document captures examples of related projects. However, the inclusion of specific projects on this list does not denote an endorsement, nor does it signal the legitimacy of said project.

## Roadmap for this document
0) Add more projects and project links
1) Provide map of blockchain projects by industry.
2) "Curate" ecosystem map to only include projects which meet some objective measure of legitimacy and usage.
3) Make it easier for anyone to contribute to this list.

### How to Contribute?
For now, create an issue to recommend a change, error, or addition to our database.

## Taxonomy
Here is a high-level framework to capture core themes for blockchain-based project development:

Here is a more specific categorization:

Notes:
* Themes are neither mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive.
* Trustless exchange, decentralization, state mutation, and tokenization span each theme.
* Projects can be industry-specific or generally applicable.

### Markets and Liquidity

Projects in this theme use the blockchain to represent value and support global exchange. They use the blockchain both as a payments / value exchange rail and to create digital scarcity.

In success, such projects will unlock global resource sharing, fractional asset ownership, and frictionless cross-border exchange.

| Project      | Category     |
|--------------|------------- |
| GridPlus     | Fungible asset exchange |
| Pangea   | Nonfungible asset exchange  |
| Airswap     | Decentralized exchange (DEX)           |

### Tracking and Authentication

### Self-Sovereign Identity

### Automated Agreements

### Token-Incentivized Markets

### Governance and Voting

### Shared Data Repos
