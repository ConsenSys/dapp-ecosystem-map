## Background
For both blockchain newcomers and OGs, it can be difficult to understand how projects are using blockchain to solve problems for end users. This document provides a framework for thinking through the various use cases of blockchain and blockchain-based technologies.

For each theme, this document captures examples of related projects. However, the inclusion of specific projects on this list does not serve as an endorsement, nor does it signal the legitimacy of specific project.

## Roadmap for this document
1) Provide ecosystem map of blockchain projects by industry.
2) "Curate" ecosystem map to only include projects which meet some objective measure of legitimacy and usage.
